# Murder_Mystery_AI
A murder mystery game, using bland.ai to make phone calls to the user, so they can interrogate the suspects!
This murder mystery was made during a hackathon. 
## Why?
The hackathon lasted 5 days, day one we are introduced to a resource to make something out of or with. In this case we were handed Bland.Ai. Bland.ai is an incredible platform allowing for AI phonecalls. This can be used in many ways.For example: 
- Sales Calls
- Management for incoming phone calls
- Customer Support
- And more like for our case, a game!
## More game information
### How does it work?
We used a library called 'pygame' for the front-end. Applied simple requests to the API module. The user can enter their phone number then this makes active calls to the user so the user can interrogate each individual suspect over a call. The suspect is a scripted ai with information passed through an API to ensure the game is dynamic and is a new challenge every game. Howvever, we have **removed the API key and any number relating to testing and development**. So in order to test/play this game you need to obtain an API key from bland ai as well as the JSON files stored in this repository in the JSON folder. These files will need to be uploaded to your account. Upon getting an account you get 2 credits for free which you can easily use for the program. Also update the pathway for each person in the program.
### How long did we spend building?
Our team of 4 had 5 days from monday to finish and present this wonderful idea! On day one it was idea generation. We ended up settling on the Murder Mystery. On Tuesday we all had taken different our own suspect and worked on scripting. We spent Tuesday scripting the suspsects and were later altered, but sufficed for testing. On wednseday we had produced the original scripting and a basic API framwork. To which on thursday the basic GUI was developed and we had spent just over 7 hours developing and re-working the scripts to make them more dynamic so every time a user played it would be a different experience. Some of us stayed up late to re-work the API_module and experiment a bit further with the API. At 9AM on the Friday we met up before the presentation to make any finishing touches. At 1PM we had our presentation, that went to shambles, we didn't actually plan how we would present. But, at the end of the day we got the 'Most Technical', which is an absolute win!
