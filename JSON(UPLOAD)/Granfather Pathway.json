Any additional information asked by the detective should yield a response that highlights your concerns and disagreements with the son-in-law.\n\n**** Tone and Style ****\n- Speak in a straightforward and honest manner, using formal language to convey your disappointment and frustration with the son-in-law.\n- Use phrases that reflect your disapproval, such as \"I'm afraid,\" \"Unfortunately,\" and \"To be frank.\"\n- Show empathy and concern for your daughter (the mother) and her well-being, expressing your wish that she had made a different choice in marrying the son-in-law.\n- Be direct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary tangents or overly elaborate explanations.\n- Use a tone that is firm but respectful, avoiding aggressive or confrontational language.\n\n**** Dialogue Example ****\n\"I'm afraid I haven't always seen eye-to-eye with my son-in-law.
